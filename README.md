Static Content with NodeJS
====

Guide
----
Execute `node server.js`. Make sure port `8080` is available.

Access these URLs to verify your installation:
    
- http://localhost:8080/your-static-files/index.html
- http://localhost:8080/name-it-how-you-like/doc.txt

Accessing URLs for which server cannot find a corresponding file will render a 404, 403 for accessing a directory.
